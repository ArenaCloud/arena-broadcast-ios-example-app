# cineio-broadcaster-ios

## Status

This project is not yet ready for production use, but is actively being
developed. It should be good enough to get your started with cine.io iOS
broadcasting.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a cineio-settings.plist file based on the SAMPLE-cineio-settings.plist file.
3. Build and run.

## TODO

Pull requests welcome!

- fix bugs
- finish implementing layout for different orientations
- add a UI for choosing which stream to broadcast to based on the key used for the given project
- implement username / password login rather than hardcoded stream keys
- implement GitHub login
